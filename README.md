Theoretical Exercise
---
**1. Briefly explain the difference between a test case and a user story.**<br>

**User Story:**<br>

User stories are often written on small cards and supposed to be brief statements of desired functionality that can be later fleshed out to obtain functional requirements for developers to code or work on to get reach the desire goal for the end product.<br>

**Test scenario:**<br>

Any functionality that can be tested for any failure before putting any application into production.<br>


**2. Considering a Continuous Integration environment, when should execution of automated tests occur?**

In a CI environment, automated tests should in theory be run after the full product is build but it will be good to do test on a phase to phase bases ot to loose track of the code and make it easier for the developer to see where the error is in the code.<br>

**3. What type of testing is at an API level?

At its most basic level, API testing is intended to reveal bugs: inconsistencies or deviations from the expected behavior. Continuous testing is also very important to make sure it continues to work when the public has access to it. The risk of putting a bad, and potentially insecure, product on the market is greater than the cost to test it.<br>

**4. When is the most effective time to involve a software quality engineer in the SDLC?**

The most effective time to involve a software quality engineer would be as early stages of the project as possible (requirements phase). Many companies do not involve QA until after design and requirements have been set. Because of this, many issues that could have been identified prior to development are not found until much later in the project and often cause redesigns mid project, sub-optimal quality, or even caveats for a release, all of which cause stress, lower morale and ultimately your userâ€™s experience to suffer.

**5. For the practical exercise, what percentage of automation vs manual testing would be ideal?**


For the given task, it makes sense to only cover ~60%. That list includes:
In manual testing (as the name suggests), test cases are executed manually (by a human, that is) without any support from tools or scripts. But with automated testing, test cases are executed with the assistance of tools, scripts, and software. Testing is an integral part of any successful software project.
